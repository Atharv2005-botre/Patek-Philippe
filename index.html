                            Lot Essay
                        </B>
                        Offered in superb condition, the present watch is one of only a handful of reference
                        5160 in white gold to appear on the auction market.

                        One of the rarest Patek Philippe modern production complicated wristwatches, the 5160G
                        is a perpetual calendar with retrograde date and moon phases. The dial with applied
                        Breguet numerals is unique to the white gold version, its design allows the display
                        of several complications in an extremely elegant and easily readable way. In the
                        upper half of the dial is the retrograde date scale numbered 1-31, when the hand
                        reaches
                        the last date of the month the hand instantly ‘flies’ back to the beginning.
                        Apertures for the days of the week at 9 o’clock and months at 3 o’clock are centred by
                        the leap-year indication below 12 o’clock. Placed in the lower half of the dial is the
                        aperture for the moon phases.

                        The story of the reference 5160 is interesting because its design was inspired by a
                        special order piece of its ‘sister’ reference 5159 that was launched in 2007 with the
                        new Officer-style case. For reference 5159, the ancient and revered art of engraving
                        was used to decorate the dial. A special order watch was subsequently granted to an
                        important client for a reference 5159 with an artisanal engraved case, that watch was
                        sold by Christie's Shanghai on 26 September 2013, lot 16. Patek Philippe was
                        reportedly so delighted by the beauty and impact of this special order piece, that
                        they decided to release an entirely new reference based upon it - reference 5160.

                        Introduced in 2010 in white, yellow or pink gold, it is thought that no more of two or
                        three dozen pieces will ever be made for each.

                        The 38 mm. diameter Officer-style case is a tribute to the master artisans of Patek
                        Philippe's rare handcrafts division. The centre of the dial, the white-gold case, the
                        hinged cover, and the clasp are lavishly decorated with entirely hand-executed
                        engravings inspired by a pocket watch in the Patek Philippe Museum collection made for
                        the American industrialist James Ward Packard. It is interesting to note that, in the
                        case of white gold 5160 but not in the case of yellow gold examples, the grooves of
                        the engraving are highlighted with blackened silver powder in order to enhance the
                        design. This subtle effect demonstrates the amazing attention to detail in every stage
                        of Patek Philippe's manufacturing process.
